Hi Sirmxe (and other interested parties)

What you see here is a new modular design for Thevalog/thundercleese.
The main class is obviously `thevalog`.
The next class of interst is IrcCmds.pm,
 which is basically an interface for Command-holding modules.
A command is like !insult or @insult.
The modules hold a bunch of related commands.
Each command then defines its help message,
 trigger command and aliases (triggers),
 and execution behavior.

Note, I'm sharing this to indicate the direction that I'm trying to go.
The code is still very erroneous, and any help is welcome.
For the time being, always run with `-I .` to allow local modules.

Hopefully, ultimately, this will replace the old thevalog AND EnigmaBot,
at which point, it can take the place of EnigmaBot.

My next plan was to add tells/msgs/seen functionality in.
