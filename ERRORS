Argument "KERNEL" isn't numeric in array element at Database.pm line 7 (#1)
    (W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
    that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
    will identify which operator was so unfortunate.



-- Author's note --
There will probably be other hidden problems/errors.
Anyone with a good background of PERL should look over the code.
As for myself, I have virtually no PERL background, I just fumbled around.
